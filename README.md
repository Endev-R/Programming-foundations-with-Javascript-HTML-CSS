Coursera's Programming foundations with Javascript-HTML-CSS course

This repository contains all my practices and code written in the period of learning programming from "Programming Foundations with JavaScript, HTML and CSS" by "Duke university", you can take the course for FREE (in AUDIT mode which is a great feature on www.coursera.org). I recommend you as a "starting programmer" to check this course at https://www.coursera.org/learn/duke-programming-web, it is really nice.
